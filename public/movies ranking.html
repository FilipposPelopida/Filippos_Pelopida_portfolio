 <h3>Inside Out 2</h3>
 <p>It was fun to watch it the sarcastic way, they showed feelings we have as teenagers.</p>

 <h3>Deadpool and Wolverine</h3>
<p>I don't have a lot to say it's deadpool, I love the action also the humor of deadpool.</p>

<h3>Borderlands</h3>
<p>( I did't watch it yet but I will! )</p>
<p>I know waht are you going to say, that I am crazy .Probably you are right but I am huge fan of the game series that goes for 
    years. I saw the trailer and I am not happy a lot but I have to experience and then I will say it's bad!</P>
